# Python-Projects
Some smaller projects I have made, primarily in Python.

Includes but is not limited to the following:
- maths expression evaluator with shunting yard algorithm
- visualisation of pathfinding and sorting algorithms
- maths and physics simulations, e.g., planet and star, conduction, Mandelbrot/Julia set zoom, matrix transformation visualiser
- raytracing from scratch rendering 3D images (and raycasting)
- a SAT solver with the DPLL algorithm
- other miscellaneous programs
